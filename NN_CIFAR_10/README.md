# Neural Network for Image Recognition on CIFAR 10 dataset

This project, is a part of stanford course assignment, which implements various machine learning models for image recognition on CIFAR 10 dataset. The models build in this project are SVM, SOFTMAX, KNN, and Two-layer neural network. The models are trained using stochastic gradient descent method. Various parameters like learning rate and decay rate were changed and tested to get the best accuracy possible. The best accuracy of 59.8% was achieved by two-layer neural net.

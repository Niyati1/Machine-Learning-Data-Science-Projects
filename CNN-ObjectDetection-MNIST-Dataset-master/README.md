# CNN-ObjectDetection-MNIST-Dataset

This project is developed based on Google Tensorflow tutorial. A model is trained on MNIST dataset and this trained model is then further used to recognize different digits in single image frame.

The test_object_detection.ipynb file has the code for detecting multiple digits in a single image and then classifying it using the trained model.

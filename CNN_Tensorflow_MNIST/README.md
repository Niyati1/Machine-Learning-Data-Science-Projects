# Classification of MNIST Dataset using Convolutional Neural Network:

This project implements classification of MNIST Dataset with Convolutional neural networks using tensorflow library. The architecture of the network is as follows: 

Input (28,28) -> Conv (5,5,32) -> maxpool (5,5) -> conv (5,5,64) -> maxpool (2,2) -> FC (1024) -> Droput (0.2) -> Softmax (10)

Accuracy: 98.15% Loss: 0.053.
